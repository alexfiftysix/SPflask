# SPflask

## Description ##
Band website for Street Pieces using Flask back-end.

## Aim ##
To create a highly-focussed website to showcase music and film clips from the band.
To have a simple user interface for the band to be able to upload their own music, film clips, photos and gig information, hidden from regular users.

## Technologies ##
Flask back end, mySQL (possibly will try Postgres for learning, or back down to MongoDB as the data has no relations)

## Current stage ##
Front-end has been created, need to upgrade the back end to be data-driven rather than hard-coded.
